              Every year, we start our celebrations with a big Republic Day
              event. It&apos;s a special day where we honor our country. We also
              celebrate Vasant Panchami and Makar Sankranti with beautiful
              rituals on campus, making the day full of happiness and
              spirituality for everyone. By the time the academic year ends in
              mid-March, students are busy practicing for our big Annual Day and
              felicitation ceremony, which happens every year on 23rd March.
              Itâ€™s a time to showcase the hard work and achievements of the
              students.
